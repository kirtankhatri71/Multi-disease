# Multi-Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of **Diabetes** and **Heart Disease** based on medical metrics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Analyzes patient data to predict diabetic risk.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Evaluates cardiovascular metrics for disease likelihood.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit
- **Model Deployment:** Pickled models (.sav) for real-time inference

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Heart Disease.ipynb` & `diabetes.ipynb`: Data preprocessing and model training.
- `MD prediction.py`: The main Streamlit application code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of necessary Python packages.
